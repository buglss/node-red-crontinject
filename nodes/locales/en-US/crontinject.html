<script type="text/html" data-help-name="crontinject">
<p>
    Injects a message manually or on a scheduled basis. The payload field in the message object can be filled in various types.
    These can be strings, json, or current time.
    It is recommended to fill at least the payload and topic fields.
</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>payload<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
    <dd>The payload area of the message object (msg).</dd>
    <dt class="optional">topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>Expressing the subject of the Node. It is the value referred to in points such as the Debug console.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
    A crontinject node can be started with a specific payload.
    The default payload value is the timestamp of the current time.
</p>
<p>
    The node can output many different types of injection results. These can be string, number, boolean, json or flow/global context.
</p>
<p>
    For manual triggering, the button on (left) of the node is clicked.
    The options on the node's editor/edit screen are used to schedule triggers.
</p>
<p>
    Flow can also be set to run once every time it starts, for example when "Deploy" is clicked or when the server starts.
</p>
<p>
    When <i>"none"</i> is selected, scheduling is turned off.
</p>
<p>
    The maximum <i>"interval"</i> that can be set is 596 hours (~24 days).
</p>
<p>
    <i>"interval between time"</i>, <i>"at a specific time"</i>, <i>"week of date"</i>, <i>"intervals between dates"</i> i>, <i>"advanced"</i>, <i>"crontime"</i> and <i>"date"</i>
    values use the standard cron system.
</p>
<p>
    When <i>"msg"</i> is selected, all properties of the node are dynamically set according to the <i>"payload"</i> value in the message object.
    The value <i>"payload"</i> must be sent as an object.
</p>
<h3>Inputs (msg)</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>repeat<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
    <dd>Gets the value in seconds. It is specified how many seconds after the injection will take place.</dd>
